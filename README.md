This is the Note-Taker application!

This application allows users to access a landing page where a link is visible to a notes page. 

When you reach the note page you are shown all of your existing notes you have saved, or empty fields if no notes have been created yet. 

When you enter a new note and note text, then a save icon will appear. 

Once you click on the save icon your note will be saved to the left-hand column for easy viewing and access. 

When you click on an existing note that note is then brought up in your right-hand column view. To edit this note you simply click the Write icon to clear the field and click the text field to begin entering your edited note. 

Here are some screeshots to see the application in action...
